### A Simulation by The Geomatics

## Overview

**BOGICHIB** is a Python-based simulation that replicates the collective behavior of a flock of birds in a 2D environment. The simulation emphasizes behaviors observed in real-world bird flocks, such as alignment, cohesion, separation, and predator avoidance. This project showcases how simple rules followed by individual birds can lead to complex, emergent flocking behaviors.

The simulation was built using Python and the Pygame library for rendering. Bird sprites and environment backgrounds were created with pixel art tools, and the project was developed in the Replit IDE.

## Features

- **Alignment:** Birds align their direction with the average heading of nearby flock members.
- **Cohesion:** Birds steer towards the average position of nearby flock members to stay together.
- **Separation:** Birds maintain a minimum distance from each other to avoid crowding.
- **Predator Avoidance:** Birds exhibit avoidance behavior when a predator is introduced.
